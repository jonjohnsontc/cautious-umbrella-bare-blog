title: About
description: My name is Jon Johnson. I'm a cat father, coffee fan, casual meme enjoyer, and software developer. I spent roughly 10 years working in music, mostly in and around music publishing, before moving into development back in 2018. In my freetime, I love working on different ways to express myself creatively through tech, playing games, and catching up on whatever reality show is big at the moment (though don't hold it against me).
