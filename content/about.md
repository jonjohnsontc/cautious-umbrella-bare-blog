title: About
description: My name is Jon Johnson. I'm a cat father, developer, and complete and utter nutcase. I spent roughly 10 years working in music, mostly in and around music publishing, before moving into software development back in 2018. Now I work as a software engineer in the media space. In my freetime, I love working on different ways to express myself creatively through software or other technology.
