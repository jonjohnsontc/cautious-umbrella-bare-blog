# Every (Programmer) Makes a Static Site Generator

And I am no exception. This is a tale about me and my own static site generator which now backs jons.gay

For as long as I've had this blog, I've used Gatsby as my framework of choice. Early on, I decided that I wanted to use something that was easy to understand and that enabled me to do cute things that I saw on other developer websites. Which is to say, interactive *good* feeling web components you'd see shared on frontend focused developer blogs like joshwcomeau.com or ...  I've used Medium in my previous career to blog, and I always wanted that touch of something special, which told people that not only was I *professional*, but good professional worthy of the magic validation that comes from your peers when you make websites like that.

Now's the time for you to tell me, "But Jon, you can do kewl, interactive, attractive web components in (virtually) any web stack, all it takes is some elbow grease and an idea". And yes, that's true, but Jon from a few years back is a different man compared to Jon from now. And Jon from back then didn't have a foundation for web technologies that Jon has now, and Jon has now wants to stop writing in third person.

Gatsby has been in the static site gen-o-sphere since 2015. It marries a number of popular js libraries together (React, React Router, and GraphQL, most notably) for a developer experience that makes painting within the lines *super nice*. The happy path in Gatsby of creating page components with JSX, and creating dynamic content in MDX is easy to follow.  

For every month that went by, an average of one article idea came into my head, or perhaps some subtle improvements to my about me page, and with that, at least one or two single page components would get added to my git tree. Pretty soon, while my website was a desert of content, the contents of my blog's repository somehow grew, with abandoned components littering my folder structure to greet me every time I lied to myself and said "TODAY, I WILL PRODUCE CONTENT". And looking at all of those files was a *pain*. Yes, it was a pain of my own construction, and probably nothing that a few solid minutes of pruning and serious reflection couldn't solve. But, it was a pain that produced enough anxiety to really ditract from writing.

I heard Jared Santo on the Changelog mention (I *think* on Kelsey Hightower's recent episode?) that every developer makes a static site generator, and I have to
