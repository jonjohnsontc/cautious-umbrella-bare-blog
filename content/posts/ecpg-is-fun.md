I've come to really appreciate SQL, and how it has come to be the common interface for accessing data in a table, even if that table isn't stored in a relational database. There's tradeoffs though, many times you have to run the query before knowing if the syntax is correct, and you generally have to make some sort of mapping between the SQL and whatever language you've chosen to do all the other fun stuff.

An ORM is one approach to handling the problem differently. I came across these when I started working on web applications, where my team had used it to handle the operations that users were able to do on our fancy dashboard generator (tm).
