            <h1 class="blog-title">"PostgreSQL Query Optimization" - A Review</h1>
            <h5 class="blog-subtitle">Published on: 2025-01-02</h5>
            <p>If you're looking to learn a about how to craft queries in PostgreSQL effectively, you have a loads of documentation, lessons, and LLMs to query that you can find on the internet. I found myself in a similar spot recently, I've previously spent some time attempting to optimize individual queries through a combination of trial and error, EXPLAIN ANALYZE, praying to foundational models, and lamenting to colleagues about how much better my DDL would‚Äôve been ‚Äîif only I‚Äôd had the benefit of years of hindsight when designing the tables. I was looking for a framework for understanding how to better craft queries in the first place, because that can save a lot of those aforementioned struggles (and importantly, my colleagues sanity).</p>
<p>I recently read 2024's "<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/979-8-8688-0069-6">PostgreSQL Query Optimization: The Ultimate Guide to Building Efficient Queries</a>", in an effort to do so, and I think it's worth your time if you're looking for something similar. At 344 pages, it's a pretty small and approachable text for building queries in a way that works with PostgreSQL as opposed to working against it. It's also less than 11% of the size of PostgreSQL's current documentation, offering an 80-20-like approach to optimization. It also includes links to download a <code>postgres_air</code> schema, a schema for a fictional airline which forms the basis of all queries in the book.</p>
<h2>Book Overview</h2>
<p>The book follows a nice flow, which starts with some baseline information on why to improve query execution time, as well as some intiuition in <em>how</em> to set and measure optimization goals. It then digs into some basic relational theory, and loosely breaks down the stages of query execution in postgres. All of this culminates with a chapter on execution plans that can be referenced throughout the remainder of the book.</p>
<p>The next part of the book delves into optimization for the two major types of queries, short and long, and the considerations that need to be made for DML (data modification) queries. Afterwards, it takes a brief look at the effects of some noteworthy configuration parameters. The remainder of the book is spent on optimizing an application's performance that leverages a database, and why one should prefer using functions and dynamic SQL as opposed to an ORM layer to define the contract between the app and db. At the very end, the authors wrap things up by providing a flow-chart for optimizing an arbitrary query using the information previously explored.</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>I want to touch on a few points in particular that I've learned and hope will stick with me:</p>
<h3>1. The Difference in Optimizing Short and Long Queries</h3>
<p>Prior to reading this book, I might've heard of <em>short</em> and <em>long</em> queries, but certainly hadn't a clue of their individual intricacies when attempting to optimize them. The terms <em>short</em> and <em>long</em> refer to the number of rows that need to be scanned relative to the size of the tables in order to provide a result for a query. </p>
<p>Depending on the type of query you have to optimize, you're looking at a slightly different path of potential modifications. Ensuring that we execute the most restrictive filter or join is often the most important, but the considerations can change up quite a bit from there. If you have a short query for instance, properly set indexes can be a huge performance multiplier. Properly set meaning, they provide coverage for the parameters being filtered and joined on<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Long queries, on the other hand can benefit from decisions beyond metadata or table structures. Those of us familiar with OLAP workflows can speak to the benefits of taking some long query and dividing it up amongst a set of incremental updates. We also are gonna be much less reliant on indexes, since a long query by definition is going to be scanning a huge portion of a table. So, making sure that we can setup queries in such a way so that we only scan large tables once can be a huge boon. I think one of the most illustrative examples is from when the author mentions using a VIEW in a large query. The VIEW is being joined against a large table, and results in several large sequental scans against the large table due to how the VIEW was initially built<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Decoupling the long query from the VIEW resulted in massive performance gains</p>
<p>I'm really just scratching the service here. The book presents a number of scenarios and optimizations to consider depending on the query type.</p>
<h3>2. Configuration Can Harm More Than Help</h3>
<p>The authors don't spend much time on PostgreSQL configuration parameters, and they state that more impactful optimizations can generally be found elsewhere<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. On other side of the coin, however, a mis-configured postgres instance could result increased query times and much lower reliability. The authors point to an example of setting <code>work_mem</code> (working memory) to some level
that would cause users to see OOM errors if the <code>max_connections</code> setting is too high. Postgres isn't going to do the math for you, so you'll need to figure out if the parameters make sense.</p>
<h3>3. The Benefits of Dynamic Query Execution</h3>
<p>Unlike say Oracle, Postgres optimizes queries as possible. This allows the db to take into account table statistics for dynamic query elements. For instance, say you have a parameterized query in your application to pull users data out, and it's based on some filter, like the users' home country, postgres is going to return an optimized query plan that's probably going to work <em>really well</em> if the filter condition has high selectivity (represents a low % of rows). Like pulling users in Turkmenistan vs a similar parameterized query in Oracle for your international app.</p>
<h3>4. NORM as an ORM alternative</h3>
<p>NORM (aka No-ORM) is an approach to mapping application data to its database in a more "database focused" way than what's typically seen by ORM-backed applications. ORM's can result in fairly succinct code on the application side of things, but they can lead to an applicaton making several database calls for a group of objects that it very well could've done in a single well-formed query (often referred to as the N+1 query problem).</p>
<p>NORM is backed by a JSON schema that defines a contract between the database and the application objects. Through this schema, objects created can be serialized to JSON, and sent to the database to be executed as a query. Once the JSON is submitted to the database, a function parses the JSON, and executes the necessary transaction. This really flips the ORM approach by making the database responsible for decomposing the object into database updates, as opposed to having the ORM make a number of small queries on behalf of the application to update the database. </p>
<p>The authors include a link to the <a href="https://github.com/hettie-d/NORM">NORM</a> framework on GitHub, which includes a set of packages that can automate building out NORM functions for your application. There is also a user guide which dives much deeper than this blog post (and the book).</p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>All-in-all, If you're looking to build a better mental model of Postgres, and how to build postgres friendly queries, I'd highly recommend it. The examples make take some time to walk all the way through if you're following along with your own postgres instance, but feels well worth the time<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. </p>

<h2 class="blog-subtitle">Footnotes</h2>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>One thing in particular that seems obvious in hindsight, is that indexes don't provide any peformance benefit if your query is applying some transformation to the index in question. If you have an index on an <code>updated_date</code> column, and then filter data in your query by using <code>MONTH(updated_date)</code> the query engine isn't going to leverage the index at all.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
