# Blog Bare

I'd like to see if I can remake the basic jons.gay site in html/css/js. Ideally probably moving to a more manageable framework solution, but with the understanding of what underpins my website now.

## How to Remake

With that said, I don't want to use any js or css frameworks, at least initially. I'm going to put it on Cloudflare pages.

## Checklist

- [x] no bulma
- [x] three pages (blog, home, about)
- [] take md pages and output html
- [x] gruvbox light color
- [] footer
- [] themeing still enabled via css

### Templating / md-to-html

- can use jinja2
- take md files from folder (maybe labeled posts/) and template data (maybe from templates/) and output html files in public/blog/
- the html files should include all the valid header information I need
